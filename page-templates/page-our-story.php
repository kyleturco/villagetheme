            The Village Nursery School was established at First United Methodist Church, West Lafayette, Ind.,
            in 1972 with the philosophy and educational understanding that young children learn best in an
            atmosphere of purposeful and productive play experiences.
            The learning activities planned, the selection of educational toys and materials, and even the
            organization of the space and the schedule give children the foundation of learning they need to
            succeed throughout their academic careers and beyond. Our programs serve children ages infant
            through preschool.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are changing weekly themes that give the children an exposure to many interesting science
            and social studies related topics. In the course of their years at Village, culminating in our
            pre-k class, the children are well prepared for entering kindergarten.
          </p>

            We are very proud of the success of our “alums." It is our goal that VNS children become independent,
            self confident, curious learners who work well with others. Besides receiving an excellent pre-reading
            and math foundation, VNS children also learn how to be a member of a group as they sing together,
            participate in interesting discussions, take turns with the weather chart and calendar, or listen
            to a story. They also learn to complete “assignments”, follow multi-step verbal directions, wait
            their turn to speak, and be responsible for their school things.

          <h2>A Note from Our Director</h2>
          <p>
            I have been one of the "Village" people for the last 6 years. Here at VNS I have played many roles
            including parent, teacher, and substitute. I'm fortunate to say VNS has been my family's "home away
            from home" for the entire time we have lived in the Lafayette area.
           </p>
           <p>
            On a professional level I have a
            Bachelor’s Degree in Elementary Education; I am also a licensed teacher in Indiana. I have taught
            many of our classes at VNS, kindergarten in Indiana and fifth grade in Virginia. I took time off of
            teaching to stay at home while my children were young.
          </p>
          <p>
            To me, every person associated with Village
            Nursery School, whether they are an employee, student, parent/guardian or FUMC church member, provides
            a unique contribution to our special school.  As Director, I hope we all find our fit in our "home away
            from home" as we work together here at Village Nursery School and FUMC.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking forward,
          </p>
