      The Parent-Infant-Toddler Program offers classes that parent/caregiver and child attend together one morning each week. This program has a long history at Village Nursery School and First United Methodist; it is one of the few such programs in the city. Each class is led by a teacher and includes an activity time, a snack, circle time and large motor time.

During activity time a variety of toys and materials are provided for parent and child to explore together. Examples may be building and transportation toys, shape and color sorters, puzzles, play dough, paint, and a sensory table for sand and water play. There is plenty of time for socializing for parents and children during this time as well.

Parents take turns providing a light, healthy snack, and then everyone participates (as they are able) in a short circle time. During circle time, the teacher shares songs and fingerplays then reads a story. Class ends with large motor play in a separate classroom.

P-I-T classes meet for 28 weeks during the school year from September through April.  The age-appropriate classes meet from 9:30-11:00AM in Room 214 and 216 at First United Methodist Church.

There is a $25 Registration Fee then $100 for each semester ($200 total for the year); a payment in September and another in January.

 The designated days for various ages are:
Tuesday Older Infants: 10-17 mo.
Wednesday Young Toddlers:  15-22 mo.
Thursday Toddlers:  20-28 mo.
Friday Older Toddlers:  24+ mo.
